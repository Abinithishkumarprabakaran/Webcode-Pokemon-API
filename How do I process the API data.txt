How to I process the API data!.

Answer:

    I'm using Async/Await function in Javascript to process the (Pokemon) API data,
using fetch funtion, which sends a request to the API's server and retrieve data from the API server,
fetch's output is always been in Promise, so it is much more easier to fetch the data from given API.

While using Await keyword for the first in the Async Function, the output will be in promise response,
and again using the await keyword to retrieve the data in the form of JSON format using .json(), so here it is
easier to fetch the data and display in the UI.

And the HTML elements all are written using DOM in Javascript,
Here everything is Dynamically approached.

And Here I used try and catch to handle the errors and if the image is not loaded, it'll throw a error message.
